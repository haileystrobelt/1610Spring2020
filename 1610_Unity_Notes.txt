We always name functions, classes, and variables

Required on every line of code:
access modifier (public, private)
datatype (i.e. string, int)
name (identifier)
semicolon (end it)

Functions and classes, the beginning word is capitilized, in variables, it is not.
Functions/classes: i.e. GameObject
Variables: i.e. gameObject
